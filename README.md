# Using a Non-Existent Tailwind CSS Class
This bug demonstrates what happens when you use a Tailwind CSS class that doesn't exist in your configuration or is misspelled. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.

## Bug
The code uses the class `bg-blu-700`, which is likely a typo for `bg-blue-700`. Because this class doesn't exist, Tailwind CSS will ignore it.  The element will not have the intended blue background color.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking the Tailwind CSS class names. This includes using the correct spelling and ensuring that the class name is defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration.  The typo is fixed below.

## How to Reproduce
1. Ensure you have a Tailwind CSS project set up.
2. Copy the code from the `bug.js` file into your project.
3. Observe that the `div` element does not have the expected styling.
4. Replace the code with the code from the `bugSolution.js` file and observe the change in styling.
